<p>This web application is designed to allow students to sell their used 
textbooks easily. There is a sign-up and login function to allow users to 
add the books they want to sell to the page. The home page contains a 
highlight of the books that are available. A listing page shows the entire 
selection of books with a sort function. All pages have a search bar at the 
top to allow users and visitors to search for a specific book.</p>

Project Requirements:
1. The Model, Views, and Controller are separated into their respective 
   folders with data manipulation being in the model folder, html pages and any 
   html code in the views folder, and url routing in the controller folder.
2. index.php utilizes Fat-Free for url routing and implements the 
   Fat-Free framework.
3. Datalayer class within datalayer.php in the model folder utilizes PDO and 
   prepared statements to run SQL code.
4. Users are allowed to add books to the database. Once the book has been 
   approved by the admin, the book is visible on the web pages.
5. Commits and comments are available in the Git repository.
6. All class objects are located in the classes folder, which include Book, 
   Person, User, and Admin. User and Admin are children to the Person class.
7. All PHP files contain Docblocs and follow PEAR standards.
8. All validation is done using validation methods server-side.
9. All code is clear with comments to explain its purpose.
10. Currently, no bugs exist and all pages work as intended.
